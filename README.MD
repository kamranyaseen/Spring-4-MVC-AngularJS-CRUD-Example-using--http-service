# Spring 4 MVC+AngularJS CRUD Example using $http service

We create a CRUD application using Spring REST API on back-end and AngularJS encapsulated within plain JSP on front-end,
communicating asynchronously with server using $http service and also perform all sorts of validation on UI using AngularJS 
Form validations.
